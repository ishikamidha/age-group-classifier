# 🧠 Age Group Classifier

This is a simple Python
project that asks for your age
and classifies it into
a group (child, teenager, adult, or senior).

## 💡 How It Works

- The user inputs their age.
- The program uses `if-elif` conditions to
 decide which age group
 they fall into.

## 📂 File

- `main.py` – contains the
 full Python code

## ✅ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Written and tested in Replit

## 🚀 Run It Yourself
1. Open `main.py` in
 Replit or any Python editor
2. Click "Run" and enter
 your age to see the result
